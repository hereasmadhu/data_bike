# 🚴‍♂️ Trail Surface Defect Dashboard

This Streamlit application allows you to visualize, compare, and analyze surface defects along trails **before and after maintenance**, using object detection results and GPS traces.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Access the live dashboard at: [https://databike-dashboard-demo.streamlit.app/](https://databike-dashboard-demo.streamlit.app/)

This interactive Streamlit dashboard allows users to visualize, compare, and analyze surface defects along trails before and after maintenance, using object detection results and GPS traces.

---

## 📥 Cloning the Repository (OPTIONAL)

You can clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hereasmadhu/data_bike.git
cd databike
```

You may then upload CSV files from the cloned folder directly through the Streamlit app interface, or **you can directly download the Jordan_Front folder and upload the csv files on the app interface.**

---

## 📘 How to Use the Dashboard

### ⬅️ Step 1: Upload Required Files

Use the **left sidebar** to upload the following four CSV files:

* **Route CSV (Before)** – GPS trace before maintenance
* **Issues CSV (Before)** – Detection results before maintenance
* **Route CSV (After)** – GPS trace after maintenance
* **Issues CSV (After)** – Detection results after maintenance

***For now, please use the same sets of GPS trace and predictions for both before and after cases.***

Make sure your CSVs contain the necessary columns:

* For route files: columns like `latitude`, `longitude`, and `timestamp`
* For issues files: `frame_filename`, `class_id`, `confidence`, `latitude`, `longitude`, and either `bbox` or individual box columns `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`

---

### 🗂️ Step 2: Configure Column Names

After uploading, select the correct **latitude**, **longitude**, and **confidence** column names for both before and after route files. The dashboard will try to guess common names like `lat`, `lon`, `latitude`, `longitude`, and `confidence`.

---

### 🖼️ Step 3: Specify Image Directory Path

Provide the relative path to the directory that contains the images referenced in the `frame_filename` column.

For example, if your image folder is named `Jordan_Holm_event_frames` and it is part of your uploaded or deployed repository, you should type:

```
Jordan_Holm/Jordan_Holm_event_frames
```

Avoid using Windows-style paths like `D:\...` or local paths like `./...`.

---

### 🚀 Step 4: Run the Analysis

Click the **"Run Comparison"** button in the sidebar to launch the dashboard view.

---

## 🗺️ Dashboard Features

* **Comparison View**: Side-by-side maps comparing defect occurrences before and after maintenance.
* **Image Gallery**: Scrollable view of annotated images.
* **Detailed View**: Click a marker or image to inspect detections, metadata, and location.
